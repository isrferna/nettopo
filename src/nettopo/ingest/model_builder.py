"""Wires ingestion -> parsers -> `NetworkModel` population (PROJECT_SPEC.md section 4).

CDP and LLDP rarely agree on what to call a neighbor: the same device is reported as
`nxos-core1` by one protocol, `nxos-core1(FDO21120U5D)` by the other (NX-OS appends the
chassis serial), and `nxos-core1.example.com` by a third device. Left unresolved, every
spelling becomes its own `Device` and one physical switch is drawn as several nodes.
`utils/hostnames.py` owns that correlation; this module feeds it every observed spelling
and rewrites each discovered link onto the canonical name it returns.

It also infers `Device.role` so `render/icons.py` has real data to key off of, from two
signals in increasing order of authority. CDP/LLDP capabilities come first: a device's own
CDP/LLDP output never reports its own capabilities, so this can only come from how its
*neighbors* describe it, and it must run on every raw discovered link, before
deduplication -- when both ends of a link are source devices, deduplication keeps only one
direction's `Link` (see `links_by_key` below), which would silently discard the only
capability report naming whichever device ends up on the discarded side. The reported
chassis then overrides that guess in `_apply_platform_roles`, once every platform string
is settled.
