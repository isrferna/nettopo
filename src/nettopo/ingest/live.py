"""Collects captures from live devices over SSH (PROJECT_SPEC.md section 4).

The `DataSource` implementation `ingest/base.py` was designed for. It runs the same
`show` commands a hand-saved capture would contain and renders them in the same
prompt-prefixed format, so everything downstream -- parsing, the model, the views -- is
unaware that the text came off a device rather than off disk.

This is the only module in nettopo that imports netmiko, and the only one that opens a
socket. `cli.py` imports it lazily so that `import nettopo.cli` neither reaches netmiko
nor requires it to be installed.
