# PROJECT_SPEC.md — Network Diagram CLI

> **Purpose of this document.** This is the master specification used to bootstrap the
> repository and drive implementation. It defines scope, architecture, the data model,
> the CLI surface, the phased delivery plan, testing, and CI/CD. It is meant to be read
> together with **`CLAUDE.md`**, which governs all engineering conventions (documentation
> maintenance, git workflow, English-only rule, SOLID/KISS/DRY/YAGNI, and the mandatory
> OWASP security review). **When `CLAUDE.md` and this spec disagree on conventions,
> `CLAUDE.md` wins.**
>
> Per the documentation-maintenance rule in `CLAUDE.md`, this file must be kept in sync
> with the code: any change to scope, architecture, model, CLI, or dependencies updates
> this spec in the same commit as `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `docs/architecture.md`.

## 1. What this tool is

A Python CLI that reads **saved `show` command outputs** from Cisco devices (files only —
no live device connections in v1) and generates **network diagrams** in **draw.io format
with Cisco icons**, plus the **intermediate data as CSV tables**.

The tool produces four diagram views from the same parsed data model:

1. **L2** — physical/link-layer topology from CDP/LLDP, with interface labels and MLAG.
2. **STP** — per-VLAN Rapid-PVST spanning-tree state (root, bridge IDs, priorities, port roles/states).
3. **HSRP** — first-hop redundancy per SVI (virtual IP, priority, active/standby/listen).
4. **BGP** — BGP neighbor (session) graph.

### Working package name

Working title: **`nettopo`** (CLI command: `nettopo`). This is a placeholder —
**verify availability on PyPI and GitHub before the first publish and rename if taken.**
The name appears throughout this document; a rename is a single coordinated change across
`pyproject.toml`, the package directory, the console-script entry point, and the docs.

**Verified (Phase 3, 2026-08-07):** `nettopo` is unclaimed on PyPI (`pypi.org/pypi/nettopo/json`
returns 404). No rename needed for the v0.1.0 release.

---

## 2. Scope

### In scope (v1)

- Read-only ingestion of `show` command outputs from a local directory.
- TextFSM parsing via **`ntc-templates`** (no ad-hoc regex parsers for production paths).
- A normalized in-memory **data model** (dataclasses).
- Four views: L2, STP, HSRP, BGP.
- L2 endpoint filtering: full diagram (all neighbors) **and** network-only (routers/switches).
- L2 interface labels and MLAG rendering **imitating current N2G behavior** (port-channel grouping).
- STP and HSRP: **per-VLAN diagrams** and **two grouping modes** (see §6).
- draw.io output with **Cisco icons** per device role.
- **CSV export** of every intermediate table (neighbors, VLANs, STP, HSRP, BGP).
- Bulk generation into a structured `output/` tree (e.g. `output/stp/`).
- A **link-label post-process** (`lucidify`) that keeps each end's label attached to its
  own end of the link and intact through a Lucidchart import.

### Explicitly out of scope (v1) — YAGNI

- Live collection over SSH (netmiko/scrapli). The ingestion layer is designed as an
  interface so this can be added later, but no networking code ships in v1.
- Nexus vPC domain/peer-link modeling. MLAG is **only** port-channel member grouping,
  matching what N2G does today.
- BGP route tables, policies, communities, route-reflector modeling. v1 is the
  **session graph only**.
- BGP `peer_device` resolution (peer IP → hostname). Left as `None` in v1, and `bgp.csv`
  reports it empty on every row. The `bgp` **view** does match a peer address against the
  interface addresses the model already holds, so that one session between two captured
  routers is drawn as one link rather than four disconnected boxes — that is a property of
  the drawing, not of the model, and it writes nothing back (see §7).
- Native Lucidchart API integration. v1 targets draw.io files that Lucid imports.
- Any telemetry or network egress. The tool must make **zero** network connections (see §11).

**Layering rule (Dependency Inversion):** dependencies point inward.
`parsing` → `model`; `views` → `model`; `render`/`export` → `views`+`model`;
`cli` orchestrates. `model` depends on nothing but `utils`. No module in `model`
imports `render`, `views`, or N2G.

---

## 4. Ingestion (v1: files only)

Input is a **directory**. Each file is one device's captured output containing several
`show` commands concatenated, each preceded by its device prompt line
(`hostname#show ...`). The prompt line is how a device is identified as a **source device**
(we have its own capture, not just a neighbor mention).

- **Encoding:** read files with `utf-8-sig` so a UTF-8 **BOM** is stripped transparently.
  (A BOM on the first line silently breaks parsing otherwise.)
- **Platform detection:** determine OS/platform per device by parsing `show version`
  when present; otherwise fall back to a CLI `--platform` default (`cisco_ios`).
  ntc-templates needs the platform to select the right template.
- **Interface:** `ingest/base.py` defines `DataSource` with a method that yields
  `(device_hint, raw_text, platform_hint)`. `FileDataSource` implements it over a directory.
  A future `LiveDataSource` can implement the same interface without touching parsing/model.

**Command set consumed (v1):**

| View | Commands |
|------|----------|
| identity | `show version` |
| L2 | `show cdp neighbors detail`, `show lldp neighbors detail`, `show etherchannel summary` (IOS/IOS-XE) or `show port-channel summary` (NX-OS) |
| L3/VLAN | `show ip interface brief`, `show interfaces`, `show vlan brief` |
| STP | `show spanning-tree` (per-VLAN Rapid-PVST), **plus** the L2 discovery commands: spanning-tree output carries a device's own bridge and port states but never names the device on the other end of a port, so the STP view takes its links from the CDP/LLDP topology. `show etherchannel summary` is required whenever links are bundled — spanning-tree names the port-channel (`Po1`) while CDP/LLDP name its members (`Gi1/0/1`), and only the bundle table joins the two. `show lldp neighbors detail` additionally lets an out-of-capture root bridge be identified, since its chassis address is the only thing that can be matched against the reported root address |
| HSRP | `show standby brief` — its shipped template captures every column the model needs (interface, group, priority, preempt, state, virtual IP), so the per-group detail form `show standby` is not read |
| BGP | `show ip bgp summary` |

---

## 5. Normalization (central services)

Two identities have to survive being spelled differently by different commands and
different devices: the **interface name** and the **device name**. Each gets exactly one
normalizer in `utils/`, and nothing else may reimplement either.

### 5.1 Interface names — `utils/interfaces.py`

`utils/interfaces.py` is the single source of truth for interface-name normalization and
**every parser must route names through it**. This prevents silent correlation failures
where the same physical port appears as `Gi1/0/1` in one command and
`GigabitEthernet1/0/1` in another and therefore never matches.

**Rule:** normalize to the **short canonical form**.

| Long form | Canonical |
|-----------|-----------|
| GigabitEthernet | `Gi` |
| TenGigabitEthernet | `Te` |
| TwentyFiveGigE | `Twe` |
| FortyGigabitEthernet | `Fo` |
| HundredGigE | `Hu` |
| FastEthernet | `Fa` |
| Ethernet | `Eth` |
| Port-channel | `Po` |
| Vlan | `Vl` |
| Loopback | `Lo` |
| Tunnel | `Tu` |
| Management | `Mgmt` |

The normalizer must be pure, deterministic, idempotent (`normalize(normalize(x)) == normalize(x)`),
and covered by exhaustive unit tests including already-abbreviated inputs and mixed casing.

`looks_like_interface()` lives here too: it answers whether a string is a recognized
interface type followed by a number, which is how `parsing/lldp.py` decides between the
neighbor's "Port Description" and its "Port id" (see §5.2 for why that matters).

### 5.2 Device names — `utils/hostnames.py`

CDP and LLDP rarely agree on a neighbor's name. The same device is reported as
`nxos-core1`, as `nxos-core1(FDO21120U5D)` (NX-OS appends the chassis serial to the name
it advertises), and as `nxos-core1.example.com`. Every spelling that is not correlated
becomes its own `Device`, so one physical switch is drawn as several nodes joined by
parallel links. `utils/hostnames.py` is the single source of truth for that correlation;
`ingest/model_builder.py` routes every CDP/LLDP-reported name through it.

**Rules**, applied to all spellings sharing one short label (the text before the first
dot, case-folded, serial suffix removed):

1. a hostname belonging to a **source device** wins — the rest of the model is already
   keyed by what that device's own `show version` reported;
2. otherwise, if a bare (domainless) spelling or exactly one domain was observed, the
   spellings are one device, named by the **shortest** observed spelling;
3. otherwise (two or more domains, no bare spelling, no source device) they stay
   separate: `sw1.site-a.com` and `sw1.site-b.com` are presumed to be two devices.

The resolver never invents a name — a canonical name is always an observed spelling
minus its serial suffix — so a device only ever seen by its FQDN keeps that FQDN. The
serial the suffix carried is preserved as `Device.serial` rather than discarded.

---

## 6. Data model

Defined in `model/entities.py`. Enums first (no bare strings for controlled vocabularies).

`Device.role` is settled in two passes, both in `ingest/model_builder.py`. CDP/LLDP
capabilities give a first answer, but they cannot tell a router from a multilayer switch —
a Catalyst 9500 advertises `Router Switch`, exactly like a bridging ISR — and a device's own
CDP/LLDP output never reports its own capabilities, so a source device depends entirely on
being described by a neighbor. `model/platforms.py` then overrides that guess by matching
the reported chassis (`cisco C9500-16X`, `N9K-C93180YC-EX`, `cisco ISR4331/K9`,
`VMware ESX`) against a table of product families. Being about the device rather than about
who saw it, that is the more authoritative of the two, and it is what makes the roles
`render/icons.py` draws — `L3_SWITCH`, `FIREWALL`, `AP`, `SERVER` — reachable at all.

`NetworkModel.hsrp` is keyed by `(vlan, group)`, so a group configured on a routed port or
a subinterface has no key to live under: `parsing/hsrp.py` skips it with a warning. That is
a deliberate v1 limit matching the HSRP view's scope (§7, "switches and their SVIs"), not a
parsing gap.

### Grouping (STP) — `model/grouping.py`

Three generation modes, exposed on the CLI as `--group-mode`:

| Mode | Meaning | Fingerprint contents |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| `per-vlan` (default) | One diagram per VLAN. No grouping. | n/a |
| `strict` | Group VLANs whose diagrams would be **identical**, including configured priorities. | Root + sorted `(device, base_priority)` + sorted `(device, interface, role, state)`. |
| `topology` (aggressive) | Group VLANs with the **same topology**, ignoring priority values. | Root + sorted `(device, interface, role, state)`. |

**Design principle:** grouping is by **resulting topology fingerprint**, never by raw
configured priority alone. Equal priority does not guarantee equal topology (differing
port costs or states can change the blocked link), and `strict` vs `topology` differ only
in whether the priority values participate in the fingerprint. The fingerprint function
lives in `grouping.py` and is the most test-critical logic in the project (see §9).

The fingerprint is per `StpVlan`, but the unit being grouped is the **VLAN**, because that
is what a diagram covers.

**Grouping is STP-only.** The HSRP view takes `--vlan`/`--all` and nothing else: grouping
means several VLANs render identically, and two VLANs' HSRP never does — each carries its
own virtual IP and its own SVI address on every router, and the virtual IP is the headline
fact of the diagram. A grouped picture could only drop every VLAN's addresses but one, or
crowd several sets of addresses onto the same nodes. `hsrp.csv` is the lossless view.

Group output naming: `stp_vlan10.drawio` (per-vlan), and for grouped modes a stable,
sorted, filesystem-safe name such as `stp_vlans-10_20_30.drawio`.

## 7. Views

Each view is a function `build(model, options) -> Diagram` that reads the model and returns
render-ready nodes/links. Views never parse text and never write files.

- **`l2`** — nodes = devices, links = `Link`s. Options: `--endpoints {all,network-only}`,
  `--link-mode {physical,port-channel}`.
  `network-only` keeps a device if `is_source` is true **or** its capabilities include
  `Router`/`Switch` (this protects source devices, which never advertise their own
  capabilities in their own CDP). Interface labels on both link ends. `--link-mode`
  selects one link per physical adjacency (default) or one link per port-channel — MLAG
  shown by port-channel grouping, imitating N2G — with the bundle's member interfaces
  carried in the link's tooltip.
- **`stp`** — switches only. Root highlighted; node labels show bridge ID + effective
  priority (with base priority available in CSV); links colored by port state
  (forwarding vs blocking) and labeled with role/state per end. Honors `--group-mode`
  and `--vlan`.
  A port-channel is one logical STP port, so its members collapse into a single link
  labeled with the bundle name, members carried in the tooltip — the same treatment
  `l2 --link-mode port-channel` gives them, but unconditional here because spanning-tree
  itself never reports the members.
  Nodes come in two kinds: a device with a capture is drawn from its own `StpBridge`,
  while a device known only from a neighbor's CDP/LLDP output is drawn faded and labeled
  with its name alone, since it has no bridge data to show. The latter is included only
  through a **non-Edge** STP port — PortFast marks the ports facing hosts, and without
  that filter every phone and access point would land in a spanning-tree diagram.
  When the root bridge is one of those uncaptured devices, it is highlighted only if an
  LLDP chassis address matches the reported root address exactly; otherwise the run warns
  and nothing is highlighted, so the diagram never guesses at a root.
- **`hsrp`** — switches and their SVIs; per group show virtual IP, each member's priority
  and role (active/standby/listen). Honors `--vlan`; there is no `--group-mode` (see §6).
  HSRP is not a topology: `show standby brief` says who shares a virtual IP, never which
  cable joins them, so unlike the STP view this one does not read `model.links` at all.
  Each group is drawn as a **virtual gateway node** — the address hosts point at — with
  one link to each router that offers it, labeled with that router's SVI, role and
  priority, colored green for active and amber for standby; the active router is
  highlighted. Each router node also carries its **own** SVI address in that VLAN, read
  from `Device.interfaces` (i.e. from `show ip interface brief`/`show interfaces`) — `show
  standby brief` names only the active and standby routers by address, so a listening
  member could not otherwise be placed. A diagram covers one VLAN and every group on it. Because a grouped diagram
  renders one representative VLAN (as the STP view does) and the virtual IP is precisely
  what differs between grouped VLANs, the gateway node names the VLAN it was drawn from.
- **`bgp`** — nodes = devices (labeled with ASN and BGP router ID, each line dropped when
  unknown), edges = BGP sessions labeled with state;
  iBGP vs eBGP styled differently (blue and purple link colors). v1 shows the
  neighbor/session graph only: one diagram for the whole network, no VLAN selection, and
  no view-specific options. A peer whose address matches no captured interface is drawn as
  its own node, labeled with that address and its ASN and faded like any other device the
  captures do not cover.

## 8. Rendering and export

### draw.io with Cisco icons — `render/`

- `render/drawio.py` wraps **N2G `drawio_diagram`** and is the **only** module that imports
  N2G. If N2G is ever replaced, only this module changes.
- `render/icons.py` owns the whole visual language: it maps `DeviceRole` → Cisco draw.io
  icon (`shape=mxgraph.cisco19.*`, the modern flat set), gives each role its own glyph
  color and its icon's native size, and supplies the link and link-label styles. On this
  shape family `strokeColor` paints the icon itself rather than a border, so the STP root
  bridge is marked with a gold card fill and an uncaptured device by fading the whole node
  — a dashed border, which the old isometric stencils used, was invisible.
- `render/legend.py` draws a diagram's key. Views declare *what* needs explaining
  (`Diagram.legend`); the samples are generated by calling the same `node_style` the
  diagram itself used, so a legend cannot drift from the picture. Legend cells are
  appended after layout and written as bare `mxCell`s, which keeps them out of both the
  spacing pass and any consumer counting the diagram's edges.
- `render/lucidify.py` post-processes the draw.io XML so link labels survive Lucid import
  and stay readable: N2G emits per-end interface labels as child-vertex cells with relative
  geometry, which Lucid mangles, and merging the two ends into one label would run them
  together into a single string — unusable in the STP view, where each end carries its own
  role/state. N2G's own construct — a label cell parented to the edge, positioned along it
  by relative geometry — is the right one and is kept: draw.io treats it as that edge's
  label, so it moves with the link and the Arrange layouts skip it. What N2G gets wrong is
  writing `relative="-1"` on the target-end label instead of `relative="1"`, which draw.io
  tolerates but a stricter importer does not; `lucidify` normalizes that flag and cleans
  malformed styles. Applied to every generated diagram by default (a `--no-lucidify` flag
  can disable it).

> **Known limitation:** `mxgraph.cisco19.*` shapes are drawn by draw.io's own code. On
> Lucid import they may degrade to plain boxes because Lucid uses a different shape
> library, and the cisco19 set makes that *less* likely to survive than the classic
> stencils it replaced, since these icons are rendered by a draw.io JavaScript shape rather
> than looked up as a named stencil. Cisco icons are a confirmed requirement and draw.io is
> where the diagrams are read and exported from, so this tradeoff is taken deliberately.
> **Status:** rendering is implemented (`render/drawio.py`, `render/icons.py`,
> `render/legend.py`, `render/lucidify.py`); the live Lucid import itself is a manual step
> not yet performed — see the checklist in `docs/architecture.md`.

### Layout

Use N2G's igraph-backed layout (`kk` default). **`igraph` is a required dependency** —
without it, layout is skipped and nodes overlap.

N2G fits that layout into one fixed-size canvas, so the algorithm decides only the layout's
*shape* — the spacing between nodes comes out the same however long their labels are, which
the STP view's per-end labels (`Gi1/0/3 designated/forwarding`) overflow. `render/drawio.py`
therefore scales the finished layout up until the closest two nodes have room for the
longest label the diagram carries, keeping the STP and L2 views legible under one rule. The
*closest* pair is deliberately what is measured, not a typical gap: scaling to a typical
gap leaves the tightest nodes overlapping. See `docs/architecture.md`, "Node spacing".

### CSV export — `export/csv_export.py`

CSV is a first-class output, not an afterthought: it is both a deliverable and the primary
debugging aid (a wrong diagram is diagnosed by inspecting the CSV to localize the fault to
parsing vs rendering). One table per entity: `devices.csv`, `interfaces.csv`,
`neighbors.csv`, `vlans.csv`, `stp.csv`, `hsrp.csv`, `bgp.csv`. STP CSV includes both base
and effective priority.

### Output tree

```
output/
├── csv/
│   ├── devices.csv
│   ├── neighbors.csv
│   └── ...
├── l2/
│   ├── l2_full.drawio
│   ├── l2_full_port-channels.drawio
│   └── l2_network-only.drawio
├── stp/
│   └── stp_vlan10.drawio ...
├── hsrp/
│   └── hsrp_vlan10.drawio ...
└── bgp/
    └── bgp.drawio
```

Filenames derived from hostnames/VLANs must be sanitized (see §11, path handling).

## 9. CLI design

Console script: `nettopo`. Subcommand per concern. Argument parsing lives only in `cli.py`;
it orchestrates ingest → parse → model → view → render/export and contains no business logic.

**Common options:** `-i/--input <dir>` (required), `-o/--output <dir>` (default `./output`),
`--platform <default>` (default `cisco_ios`), `--no-lucidify`, `--log-level`.

```
nettopo parse   -i ./captures                      # parse only; write all CSV tables
nettopo l2      -i ./captures [--endpoints all|network-only] [--link-mode physical|port-channel]
nettopo stp     -i ./captures [--vlan N | --group-mode per-vlan|strict|topology] [--all]
nettopo hsrp    -i ./captures [--vlan N] [--all]
nettopo bgp     -i ./captures
nettopo all     -i ./captures                      # every view + every CSV
```

- `--link-mode` default is `physical`; `port-channel` writes a `_port-channels`-suffixed
  filename so both link modes can coexist in one output directory.
- `--vlan N` restricts to one VLAN (single diagram); mutually exclusive with `--group-mode`.
- `--group-mode` is `stp`-only and defaults to `per-vlan`; `hsrp` rejects it (see §6).
- `--all` for `stp`/`hsrp` writes every resulting diagram into `output/<view>/`.
- `all` takes the common options only. It runs the per-VLAN views over every VLAN with
  `--group-mode per-vlan`, and writes the three L2 diagrams of the §8 output tree
  (physical, port-channels, network-only). A view the captures hold no data for is skipped
  with a warning and the run still exits 0; only an unreadable input or a failed write is
  an error. `nettopo <view>` named explicitly still writes its diagram, empty.

## 10. Dependencies

**Runtime:** `n2g`, `textfsm`, `ntc-templates`, `python-igraph`.

> **Do NOT depend on or install Flask/Werkzeug.** N2G's optional V3D viewer imports Flask
> at module load; with Flask present but an incompatible Werkzeug on Python 3.12, that
> import poisons the startup of **every** N2G command (`ast.Str` / `NameError: app`).
> We never use the V3D viewer, so Flask must stay absent from the environment. If a future
> need arises, isolate it in a separate optional extra and a separate Python 3.11 venv.

**Dev:** `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `ruff` (lint + format), `mypy` (type checking),
`build`/`twine` (packaging). Pin versions in `pyproject.toml`.

Target Python: **3.11+** (dataclasses with `X | None`, modern typing).

## 11. Security review (OWASP-adapted)

Per `CLAUDE.md`, every change is checked against OWASP Top 10 (2021). For a local,
file-reading CLI the relevant items are:

- **A03 Injection** — parsing is done by the TextFSM engine over template **data**;
  never `eval`/`exec`/`os.system` on parsed content or filenames. CLI parsing via the
  standard argument parser.
- **A08 Software & Data Integrity** — no `pickle`, no `yaml.load` (use `safe_load` if YAML
  is ever added). TextFSM templates come from the installed `ntc-templates` package, not
  from user-supplied executable code.
- **Path handling (traversal)** — validate and normalize `--input`/`--output`. Output
  filenames are derived from hostnames and VLAN ids: **sanitize** them (strip path
  separators, quotes, whitespace) so a device named `../../etc` can't escape the output
  directory. Refuse to write outside the resolved output root.
- **Sensitive data** — inputs contain hostnames, management IPs, and topology. The tool
  must not transmit them anywhere. **Hard requirement: zero network connections in v1.**
  This is enforced by a test (`tests/test_no_network.py`) that monkeypatches
  `socket.socket` to fail and asserts a full `all` run still succeeds — proving no code path
  opens a socket. This is a verifiable guarantee, not a promise in prose.
- **A10 SSRF** — not applicable in v1 (no server-side fetch). Becomes relevant only when
  live collection is added; at that point target host and credential handling get their own
  review.

If a change touches any of the above and the mitigation isn't obvious from the diff, call it
out in the PR description.

## 12. Testing strategy

- **Parsers** — the highest-value tests: deterministic text-in / structure-out. Store
  anonymized real captures in `tests/fixtures/` and assert the produced model objects.
  Cover IOS and IOS-XE output variants.
- **Interface normalizer** — exhaustive table-driven tests, including idempotency and
  already-abbreviated inputs.
- **Grouping fingerprints** — dedicated tests, especially the boundary case: **same
  priority, different topology** (must NOT group under `strict` **or** `topology` when the
  blocked link differs), and **same topology, different priority** (must group under
  `topology` but NOT under `strict`).
- **Views/render** — assert the draw.io XML is well-formed and that expected nodes/links
  exist; do not assert pixel positions. Node *spacing* is the exception: how far apart the
  closest two nodes end up is a property the layout owes the labels, so it is asserted —
  but still never where any individual node is.
- **No-network** — see §11.

Coverage target: meaningful coverage on `parsing`, `model`, and `views`; `render` covered
at the well-formed-XML level.

---

## 13. CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

- **On every push / PR:** `ruff check` + `ruff format --check`, `mypy`, `pytest --cov`.
  The pipeline must be green from the very first commit of Phase 0.
- **On tag `v*`:** build sdist+wheel and publish to PyPI via trusted publishing
  (OIDC, no long-lived token in secrets).
- Branch protection on `main`: no direct pushes; PRs require passing checks.

---

## 14. Delivery plan (sequential GitHub issues)

Each phase is one or more issues. Per `CLAUDE.md`: branch per issue
(`feat/…` / `fix/…`), open a PR into `main`, never commit to `main` directly, and update
`README.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` / `docs/architecture.md` / this spec in the same commit as the
change.

- **Phase 0 — Scaffolding.** Repo, `pyproject.toml`, `src/` layout, empty CLI skeleton,
  Actions pipeline (lint + type + test) green, branch protection, issue labels. No logic.
- **Phase 1 — Foundations.** Interface normalizer (`utils/interfaces.py`) with full tests;
  data model dataclasses + enums (`model/entities.py`); grouping fingerprints
  (`model/grouping.py`) with tests. Nothing user-visible yet.
- **Phase 2 — L2 parsing + CSV.** `ingest/files.py`, CDP/LLDP parsers, `version.py`,
  populate the model, `nettopo parse` writing all CSV tables. First tangible output.
- **Phase 3 — L2 view (v0.1 release).** draw.io render wrapper, icons, endpoint filter
  (`all` / `network-only`), interface labels, MLAG, `lucidify`. **Validate Lucid import
  fidelity here.** First usable PyPI release.
- **Phase 4 — STP.** `spanning_tree.py` parser, `StpVlan` population, per-VLAN + both
  grouping modes, `output/stp/` bulk generation, STP CSV.
- **Phase 5 — HSRP.** `hsrp.py` parser, `standby brief`, per-VLAN + grouping, `output/hsrp/`,
  HSRP CSV. Structurally analogous to STP.
- **Phase 6 — BGP.** `bgp.py` parser (`bgp summary`), session graph, iBGP/eBGP styling,
  BGP CSV. `peer_device` stays `None`.
- **Phase 7 — Polish.** `lucidify` refinements, per-view layout tuning, docs, `nettopo all`.

Each phase after Phase 3 is an incremental PyPI release. Publish early; L2 done well is
worth more than a half-finished grand plan.

## 15. Documents to keep in sync

Per `CLAUDE.md`, these are updated together whenever behavior/structure/deps change:
`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and this
`PROJECT_SPEC.md`. None may describe a state of the project that no longer exists.
